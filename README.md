# Grid Canon

This is a complete JavaScript and HTML5 implementation of Tom Francis' solitare card game [Grid Canon](https://www.pentadact.com/2019-08-20-gridcannon-a-single-player-game-with-regular-playing-cards/). This project intentionaly has minimial frills in its overall asthetic and animations. The goal was to create a game that you can quickly start playing in a browser on any device - similar to wordle and other HTML5 games.

If you want to play, the game is live on https://gridcanon.com
